To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/XXXXXXXXXX).

## Compatibility

When I code, I work locally with XAMPP on Windows. My projects work for this stack.

There's no guarantee of compatibility with other software or versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many specific things.

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/XXXXXXXXXX/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
